# evolution-simulator
simulation of evolution in python using pygame

This evolution simulator attempts to simulate Darwin's Theory of Evolution. 
The red dot is the "goal" of the dots (and really their only purpose of life.)
The dots further from the goal do not get to asexually reproduce, wheras
the ones closer to the goal do get to reproduce. 

TODO: 

-Count steps, lower fitness if more steps, raise if less

-Sexual Reproduction
